# rectangle-es6

This repository contains my solution to the following challenge.

The goal is to create a Web application, without using any third-party framework, that fullfills following requirements :
* user must be able to draw rectangles of random colors using the mouse.
* when double-clicking on a rectangle it does a 360Â° rotation and disappears once the rotation's done.
* when double-clicking on several rectangles, all the rotations must be done before removing the rectangles.
